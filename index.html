     <p style='text-align:centre'><strong>As humanity starts advancing further into science and techonologies,
     they starts to grow away from the one who created them by creating and inverting their own idols.
      It's scarce now a days to differentiate between the true followers of christ and those who aren't.
       ..</strong/p>
       <p><strong>One More Soul For JESUS</strong> is a group organised by the students in Papua New Guinea as
         a means of students reaching students, conducting outreaches, crusades, retreats, prayer meetings and
         other practices to create a condisive environment in such times so as to bring across a sense of awareness of the creator
         in every parts of this earth as far as they can reach.</p>

      <h2> BRIEF HISTORY</h2>
      <p><strong>During the time of one of the major covid lockdown of 2020, the Scripture Union students, the PNG Bible church,the Luthren and the Inter-denominational
        students at the Sogeri National school of excellence came together to conduct their end of year function. It was a mini function organised for the out 
        going executives of the relegious student's leaders of that year.
        Although it was a tough year God was doing so much for us, this include the amazing idea to create a group that can unite us as one body of christs
        after knowing what was waiting for us back at home; the relegious, cultural and other physical barriers will distanced us after leaving school.<br/>
        The idea about this move was brought to life one year after the actual discussion however a few students make an attenpt to conduct mini crusades
        in their home provinces. Since most of the members were selected to the University of Papua New Guinea,a commitee was then formed.
        Since then not only do we have members from Sogeri but students from across PNG as well as graduants and proffessionals and other likeminded
        people from local churches in the country.<br>
      After all it not only help others but the members as well in physicsl and mentall aspect as well.<br>
      Students after being faithful church goers in high schools and secondary schools tent to act th exact opposite when entering tertiary instutitions
      however not only do we want to target them but the general lost souls.
